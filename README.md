# python-inheritance
This Python program simulates a simple greeting card system. It contains classes for different types of greeting cards, such as Birthday Cards and Christmas Cards, and allows you to personalize the message for a recipient.

The program defines three classes:

1. **Card**: A base class that stores the recipientâ€™s name and provides a basic greeting message.
2. **Birthday_Card**: A subclass of **Card** that overrides the `mssg` method to print a birthday-specific message.
3. **Christmas_Card**: A subclass of **Card** that overrides the `mssg` method to print a Christmas-specific message.
